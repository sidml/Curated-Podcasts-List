There are lots of great podcasts coming out these days. I wanted to compile a list of some of the great ones. This repo contains a curated list of podcasts on the following topics:
1. JavaScript
2. Machine Learning
3. Python
4. Web Development
5. Data Visualization

You can find a Word Cloud Visualization associated with each podcast, which will hopefully give you an idea about the podcast contents. I hope you find this repo useful :-)
