# Curated List of Web Development Podcasts
There are lots of great podcasts coming out these days. I wanted to compile a list of some of the great ones. This list contains only currently running podcasts (atleast 1 episode in the past month). I have also included some tangentially related podcasts that you may find interesting. You can find a Word Cloud Visualization associated with each podcast, which will hopefully give you an idea about the podcast contents. I hope you find this list useful :-)
